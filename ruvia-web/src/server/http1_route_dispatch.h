// What every HTTP/1 route dispatch needs from the session that owns the
// request: the transport, the worker's memory and scanner entry, the parsed
// head, the route table and services to run the handler with, the options, the
// response being built, and the keep-alive sequence. Each dispatcher takes this
// and adds only what its own kind of route needs.
//
// Passed by value, as its members were as separate arguments: the references
// cost nothing to copy and context_services is copied per dispatch either way.
