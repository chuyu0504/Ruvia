// What starting an HTTP/2 server session takes from the connection that hands
// it over: the stream to speak on, the socket underneath it, the worker's
// memory and scanner entry, and the routes, options, services and worker state
// every request on the session will be served with. All of it is per
// connection, so it is gathered once where the connection is accepted rather
// than threaded through each entry point.
